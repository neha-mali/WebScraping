NAME-

How To Run-
python data.py

DESCRIPTION-
The CNN Money’s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ ) tracks the most active stocks on a real time basis. Specifically, the most active, the top 
gainers and top losers are listed at any instance in time.The program takes the ticker symbols and names of these companies (and categories) and builds a csv file 
(called Stock.csv) with data about each stock from the website: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD? , which gives the quote for ticker symbol AMD as an example.The code 
also lists the names of the companies in the order and categories listed in the website: https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ and ask the user to choose a company to get 
the data on. Once the user chooses the company of interest, the program displays its corresponding data (Open, Prev Close, Volume and Market Cap).

Output is printed to the Stock.csv file.
